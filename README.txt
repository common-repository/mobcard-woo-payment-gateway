== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Who can use this plugin? =

Any merchant that contracted mobilPay credit/debit card payment processing services.
Basically romanian companies.

= Can I take payments from PayPal? =

No. You can only take payments from credit/debit card processed by mobilPay only.

= How can I add my merchant certificates? =

Sandbox:

If you want to test the plugin under sandbox enviroment, upload your testing `private.key` and `public.cer` files into `certificates` folder of the plugin.

These certificates should look like this: `sandbox.XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXprivate.key` and `sandbox.XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX.public.cer`.

Live:

Upload your live `private.key` and `public.cer` files into `certificates` folder of the plugin.

These certificates should look like this: `live.XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXprivate.key` and `live.XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX.public.cer`.

Note:

Don't rename `.key` and `.cer` files and make sure that `XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX` matches your Merchant ID.

= Payment redirect is not working. Why? =

WooCommerce plugin fails to load jQuery Cookie JavaScript due to current Mod_Security ruleset on your web server. Files: `jquery.cookie.js` and `jquery.cookie.min.js`, located inside folder `/plugins/woocommerce/assets/js/jquery-cookie/` may cause some issues with "Order" button and other minor template issues if not loaded properly.

To fix this small issue folow these steps:

Step 1: Login to FTP then rename files inside folder `/plugins/woocommerce/assets/js/jquery-cookie/`:

`jquery.cookie.js` into `jquery_cookie.js`
`jquery.cookie.min.js` into `jquery_cookie.min.js`

Step 2: Inside folder `/wp-content/themes/` find theme which is in use, for example, twentyfourteen then add following lines into `functions.php`:

`add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'custom_woo_cookie_frontend' );`

`function custom_woo_cookie_frontend() {
  global $post, $woocommerce;
  $suffix = defined( 'SCRIPT_DEBUG' ) && SCRIPT_DEBUG ? '' : '.min';
  wp_deregister_script( 'jquery-cookie' );
  wp_register_script( 'jquery-cookie', $woocommerce->plugin_url() . '/assets/js/jquery-cookie/jquery_cookie' . $suffix . '.js', array( 'jquery' ), '', true );
}`

Now the JavaScript files `jquery_cookie.js` and `jquery_cookie.min.js` won't produce 404 errors due to Mod_Security module interference.
